### Step 7:
Steps: I typed `vim ListExamples.java` into the terminal then hit `<enter>`. The I typed, in order, `<k><l><l><d><w><i><index2><Spacebar><esc><:wq>`. Those commands changed "index1" to "index2" then `:wq` saved the changes. 
Each keystroke I used served a purpose in navigating or served some other useful purpose allowing me to complete the changes I needed to. Here is a full list of vimm commands with explanations included: [vim commands](https://vimm.rtorr.com/). To fins explanations of the ommand I used specifically, use ctrl F and type in the command you wish to see explained. Then hit enter and enjoy learning!

### Step 8: 
Steps: Once again, just like in step 6 , I typed `bash test.sh` to see if the tests were now successfull, which they were.
